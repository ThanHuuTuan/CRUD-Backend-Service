# CRUD-Backend-Service
CRUD backend service which consists of a worker (consumer) and the following APIs: Get: Search in cache first and fallback to the db in case of a cache miss, post, put, delete, submit: Submit an async joband return a job_id, results: Get the results of a previously submitted job. Points to note: each item in the cache has some TTL set, cache is always in sync with the db (insert / update / delete operations), proper logging in all relevant areas. Tech Stack: Python3 + Flask, PSQL, Celery (job scheduling), RabbitMQ (message broker) and Redis (cache).
